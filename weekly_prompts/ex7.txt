Exercise 7 
Identifying what we really want 
 
1) Think about the ways that you use self-criticism as a motivator.  Is there any personal trait that 
you criticize yourself for having (too overweight, too lazy, too impulsive, etc.) because you think 
being hard on yourself will help you change?  If so, first try to get in touch with the emotional 
pain that your self-criticism causes, giving yourself compassion for the experience of feeling so 
judged. 
 
2) Next, see if you can think of a kinder, more caring way to motivate yourself to make a change 
if needed.  What language would a wise and nurturing friend, parent, teacher, or mentor use to 
gently point out how your behavior is unproductive, while simultaneously encouraging you to do 
something different.  What is the most supportive message you can think of that's in line with 
your underlying wish to be healthy and happy? 
 
3) Every time you catch yourself being judgmental about your unwanted trait in the future, first 
notice the pain of your self-judgment and give yourself compassion. Then try to reframe your 
inner dialogue so that it is more encouraging and supportive.  Remember that if you really want 
to motivate yourself, love is more powerful than fear.
