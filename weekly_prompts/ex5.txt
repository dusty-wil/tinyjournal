Exercise 5 
Changing your critical self-talk 
 
This exercise should be done over several weeks, and will eventually form the blueprint for 
changing how you relate to yourself long-term.  Some people find it useful to work on their inner 
critic by writing in a journal.  Others are more comfortable doing it via internal dialogues.  If you 
are someone who likes to write things down and revisit them later, journaling can be an excellent 
tool for transformation.  If you are someone (like me) who never manages to be consistent with a 
journal, then do whatever works for you.  You can speak aloud to yourself, or think silently. 
 
1) The first step towards changing the way to treat yourself is to notice when you are being self
critical.  It may be that – like many of us - your self-critical voice is so common for you that you 
don't even notice when it is present.  Whenever you're feeling bad about something, think about 
what you've just said to yourself. Try to be as accurate as possible, noting your inner speech 
verbatim.  What words do you actually use when you're self-critical?  Are there key phrases that 
come up over and over again?  What is the tone of your voice – harsh, cold, angry?  Does the 
voice remind you of any one in your past who was critical of you?  You want to be able to get to 
know the inner self-critic very well, and to become aware of when your inner judge is active.  
For instance, if you've just eaten half a box of Oreo's, does your inner voice say something like 
"you're so disgusting," "you make me sick," and so on?  Really try to get a clear sense of how 
you talk to yourself. 
 
2) Make an active effort to soften the self-critical voice, but do so with compassion rather than 
self-judgment (i.e., don't say "you're such a bitch" to your inner critic!).  Say something like "I 
know you're worried about me and feel unsafe, but you are causing me unnecessary pain. Could 
you let my inner compassionate self say a few words now?" 
 
3)  Reframe the observations made by your inner critic in a friendly, positive way.  If you're 
having trouble thinking of what words to use, you might want to imagine what a very 
compassionate friend would say to you in this situation.  It might help to use a term of 
endearment that strengthens expressed feelings of warmth and care (but only if it feels natural 
rather than schmaltzy.)  For instance, you can say something like "Darling, I know you ate that 
bag of cookies because you're feeling really sad right now and you thought it would cheer you 
up.  But you feel even worse and are not feeling good in your body.  I want you to be happy, so 
why don't you take a long walk so you feel better?"  While engaging in this supportive self-talk, 
you might want to try gently stroking your arm, or holding your face tenderly in your hands (as 
long as no one's looking).  Physical gestures of warmth can tap into the caregiving system even 
if you're having trouble calling up emotions of kindness at first, releasing oxytocin that will help 
change your bio-chemistry.  The important thing is that you start acting kindly, and feelings of 
true warmth and caring will eventually follow.
