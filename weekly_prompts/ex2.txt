Exercise 2 
Self-Compassion Break 
 
Think of a situation in your life that is difficult, that is causing you stress.   
Call the situation to mind, and see if you can actually feel the stress and emotional discomfort in your body. 
 
Now, say to yourself: 

1. This is a moment of suffering         
    That's mindfulness.  Other options include:  
        - This hurts.  
        - Ouch. 
        - This is stress. 
 
2.  Suffering in a part of life     
    That's common humanity.  Other options include:  
        - Other people feel this way.   
        - I'm not alone.   
        - We all struggle in our lives. 
 
Now, put your hands over your heart, feel the warmth of your hands and the gentle touch of your hands on your chest.  
Or adopt the soothing touch you discovered felt right for you. 
 
Say to yourself: 

3.  May I be kind to myself  
    You can also ask yourself, "What do I need to hear right now to express kindness to myself?"  Is there a phrase that 
    speaks to you in your particular situation, such as:   
        - May I give myself the compassion that I need  
        - May I accept myself as I am.
        - May I learn to accept myself as I am.  
        - May I forgive myself.  
        - May I be strong.  
        - May I be patient.
 
This practice can be used any time of day or night, and will help you remember to evoke the three aspects of 
self-compassion when you need it most
