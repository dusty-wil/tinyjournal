Exercise 3 
Exploring self-compassion through writing 
 
Part One:  
Everybody has something about themselves that they don't like; something that causes them to 
feel shame, to feel insecure, or not "good enough."  It is the human condition to be imperfect, 
and feelings of failure and inadequacy are part of the experience of living a human life.  Try 
writing about an issue you have that tends to make you feel inadequate or bad about yourself 
(physical appearance, work or relationship issues…) What emotions come up for you when you 
think about this aspect of yourself? Try to just feel your emotions exactly as they are – no more, 
no less – and then write about them.   
 
Part Two: 
Now think about an imaginary friend who is unconditionally loving, accepting, kind and 
compassionate. Imagine that this friend can see all your strengths and all your weaknesses, 
including the aspect of yourself you have just been writing about.  Reflect upon what this friend 
feels towards you, and how you are loved and accepted exactly as you are, with all your very 
human imperfections.  This friend recognizes the limits of human nature, and is kind and 
forgiving towards you.  In his/her great wisdom this friend understands your life history and the 
millions of things that have happened in your life to create you as you are in this moment.  Your 
particular inadequacy is connected to so many things you didn't necessarily choose: your genes, 
your family history, life circumstances – things that were outside of your control.   
 
Write a letter to yourself from the perspective of this imaginary friend – focusing on the 
perceived inadequacy you tend to judge yourself for.  What would this friend say to you about 
your "flaw" from the perspective of unlimited compassion? How would this friend convey the 
deep compassion he/she feels for you, especially for the pain you feel when you judge yourself 
so harshly?  What would this friend write in order to remind you that you are only human, that 
all people have both strengths and weaknesses?  And if you think this friend would suggest 
possible changes you should make, how would these suggestions embody feelings of 
unconditional understanding and compassion? As you write to yourself from the perspective of 
this imaginary friend, try to infuse your letter with a strong sense of his/her acceptance, kindness, 
caring, and desire for your health and happiness. 
 
After writing the letter, put it down for a little while.  Then come back and read it again, really 
letting the words sink in.  Feel the compassion as it pours into you, soothing and comforting you 
like a cool breeze on a hot day.  Love, connection and acceptance are your birthright. To claim 
them you need only look within yourself.
