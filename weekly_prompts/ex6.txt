Exercise 6 
Self-compassion journal 
 
Try keeping a daily self-compassion journal for one week (or longer if you like.)  
Journaling is an effective way to express emotions, and has been found to enhance both mental 
and physical well-being.  At some point during the evening when you have a few quiet moments, 
review the day's events.  In your journal, write down anything that you felt bad about, anything 
you judged yourself for, or any difficult experience that caused you pain. (For instance, perhaps 
you got angry at a waitress at lunch because she took forever to bring the check.  You made a 
rude comment and stormed off without leaving a tip.  Afterwards, you felt ashamed and 
embarrassed.)  For each event, use mindfulness, a sense of common humanity, and kindness to 
process the event in a more self-compassionate way.    
 
Mindfulness.  This will mainly involve bring awareness to the painful emotions that arose 
due to your self-judgment or difficult circumstances.  Write about how you felt: sad, ashamed, 
frightened, stressed, and so on.  As you write, try to be accepting and non-judgmental of your 
experience, not belittling it nor making it overly dramatic. (For example, "I was frustrated 
because she was being so slow.  I got angry, over-reacted, and felt foolish afterwards.") 
Common Humanity.  Write down the ways in which your experience was connected to 
the larger human experience.  This might include acknowledging that being human means being 
imperfect, and that all people have these sorts of painful experiences.  ("Everyone over-reacts 
sometimes, it's only human.")  You might also want to think about the various causes and 
conditions underlying the painful event. ("My frustration was exacerbated by the fact that I was 
late for my doctor's appointment across town and there was a lot of traffic that day.  If the 
circumstances had been different my reaction probably would have been different.") 
Self-Kindness.  Write yourself some kind, understanding, words of comfort.  Let yourself 
know that you care about yourself, adopting a gentle, reassuring tone. (It's okay.  You messed up 
but it wasn't the end of the world.  I understand how frustrated you were and you just lost it.  
Maybe you can try being extra patient and generous to any wait-staff this weekâ€¦") 
 
Practicing the three components of self-compassion with this writing exercise will help 
organize your thoughts and emotions, while helping to encode them in your memory.   If you 
keep a journal regularly, your self-compassion practice will become even stronger and translate 
more easily into daily life.
