Exercise 1 
How would you treat a friend? 
 
Please take out a sheet of paper and answer the following questions: 
1. First, think about times when a close friend feels really bad about him or herself or is really struggling in some way. 
How would you respond to your friend in this situation (especially when you're at your best)? Please write down what you 
typically do, what you say, and note the tone in which you typically talk to your friends. 
 
2. Now think about times when you feel bad about yourself or are struggling.  How do you typically respond to yourself in 
these situations? Please write down what you typically do, what you say, and note the tone in which you talk to yourself. 
 
3. Did you notice a difference?  If so, ask yourself why.  What factors or fears come into play that lead you to treat 
yourself and others so differently?   
 
4. Please write down how you think things might change if you responded to yourself in the same way you typically respond 
to a close friend when you're suffering.  
 
Why not try treating yourself like a good friend and see what happens?
